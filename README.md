Fulcrum is a multipurpose solution for patients management in the field of movement sciences. Fulcrum allows up to standards profiling, compliant with the WHO International Classification of Functioning and Disabilities (ICF), intervention planning and creation, progress tracking, and calendarization functionalities for movement scientists, physiotherapist, kinesiologists, exercise physiologist and physical educators. 
The broad idea behind Fulcrum is to have a professional software that can be leveraged for these professions and their job environment to allow seamless person management, follow-up and data storage.
Fulcrum is currently in pre-alpha and it has just the basic functionalities implemented (not absent of bugs!) such as:

### What it does

1. Creation of patients records;
	1. For each patient record, it can record important anamnestic informations, sociodemographical details and several ICF related data;
2. Creation of a intervention up to standard with diverse consensus guidelines on physical activity administration, used as theraphy, training or education/development;
3. A profile dashboard which includes an up to standard ICF approach, displaying goals, time frames and a summary sheet of functionings with relevant categories and items from the framework;
4. A minimalistic calendar component apt to a time dimensional visualization of the ongoing intervention;

Fulcrum leverages the  Electron framework based on the popular Node.js runtime to deliver what today is just a desktop version (and only for Windows at the moment) of the software, but in the future not only multi operating system, but also multi-platform one (smartphone or tablet).

### What's my goal

I was always craving a good digital solution that would incorporate all the quality standards and evidence based code of praxis in terms of movement sciences. Being quite versed not only in general physical education, but also in adapted physical acitivity and rehabilitation and aspiring to expand my horizons in the future, I have found the medical sub-field of movement sciences very disjoint and uncohorinated in terms of "how to work". Due to having had the fortune to explore this field in different countries, and even in the same country, most of the aforementioned professional figures do not have a code of praxis or a standard way to approach the person, even though the international bodies have produced several frameworks of reference or consensus literature.
With Fulcrum the effort is not only digital, but also to invite a common code of praxis, even if the underlying means and methods would eventually differ between professionals, as a general approach to movement applied sciences. 
This is an effort in the direction of providing better care through the overcoming of barriers by creating a point of communal meeting: the person, client, patient. 

### What's the future

As ambitious as it is, I envision Fulcrum to be an international reality among movement sciences professional. Not only with the improvement and growth of this single digital solution, but also with the addition of other applicatives to the family which will involve other aspect of the active person management in the spirity of communal effort and relationality.

Professionals all over the world are invited into trying, utilizing and give suggestions about Fulcrum, what they would like from it, and what they see fit being a valid addition to its many functionalities.
This will help cradle much more experienced and entusiastic points of view and eventually nurture this project to what I think it can achieve.

Future project for Fulcrum are, in terms of effort and time priority:

1. Constant improvement of the base code, functionalities and performance;
2. Addition of new functionalities to facilitate the work of movement sciences professional in the broad sense;
3. The publishing of the user manual that will be also a hybrid educational textbook that will contain important evidence based information of praxis guidelines; 
4. Development of affiliated software solutions such as the patient smartphone app to visualize and keep track of their journey and treatment;
5. Integrated data analytics tools;

And even more. This is just the beginning, Fulcrum has the potential to be one of a kind in terms of management solutions of the patient in the field of movement sciences.
