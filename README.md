Fulcrum is a management software for experts in the field of movement sciences, such as physical education, adapted physical activity and physical rehabilitation. 

### What it does

1. Creation of a person's profile, including anamnestic informations, sociodemographical details and several ICF related data;
2. Creation of interventions that range from educational, rehabilitative and sportive;
3. A profile dashboard which includes an up to standard ICF approach, displaying goals, time frames and a summary sheet of functionings with relevant categories and items from the framework;
4. Allows for fast creation, logical overview through flow diagram of both the profile and the intervention;

### What's my goal

Creating a management solution that will allow to switfly create, compare and analyze data on single persons, multiple or groups or teams and produce document outputs that can be shared among different professional that contribute to the overall wellbeing and success in the field of movement.

### What's the future

At the moment the app is in heavy development. Implementing the basic functionalities is the first big milestone. The app has been rewritten from scratch compared to the previous version. 
Here is a brief Roadmap of the future features and big updates:

1.	First goal of having the basic functionalitis: creating a profile, creating multiple interventions for each person, handling one person at the time, saving the workspace locally to resume at runtime;
2. Implementing various quality of life functionalities that will further distance the app from non-specific competitors such as spreadsheets or other not dedicated solutions:
	* Adding the possibility to quickly duplicate sessions, microcycles or phases of work;
	* Adding the possibility to order the entire flow diagram based on specific criteria;
	* Adding the option to templating either phases, microcycles or sessions to quickly re-use them for other interventions [!important];
3. Further down the road the overall goal is to implement data analysis capabilities for evidence based, data oriented decision making in terms of designing interventions and reading outcomes (which is crucial for every professional figure);
